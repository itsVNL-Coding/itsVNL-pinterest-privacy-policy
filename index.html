<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>Last updated: <strong>February 2025</strong></p>

<p>This Privacy Policy explains how our service (“the App”) handles data when connecting to Pinterest using the official Pinterest API. Our purpose is to allow users to create Pins from affiliate products (e.g., Amazon or Temu) using user‑approved workflows. We are committed to respecting user privacy and complying with all Pinterest Developer Guidelines.</p>

<hr>

<h2>1. What the App Does</h2>
<p>The App allows users to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Create Pins to their Pinterest account with affiliate product links.</li>
    <li>Automate the Pin creation process using user‑configured workflows (e.g., via n8n).</li>
    <li>Manage their content creation tasks in a centralized way.</li>
</ul>

<p>All actions require explicit user confirmation, and the App does not perform any Pinterest actions on behalf of a user without their full knowledge and consent.</p>

<hr>

<h2>2. How Pinterest Data Is Accessed</h2>
<p>The App uses Pinterest’s OAuth 2.0 flow. Users must explicitly authorize the App to access their Pinterest account. We do <strong>not</strong> request or store Pinterest passwords, session cookies, or login credentials.</p>

<p>Once authorized, the App may access:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Your public profile information</li>
    <li>Your boards (to allow you to choose where a Pin will be published)</li>
    <li>Posting capabilities for creating Pins (only when you initiate the action)</li>
</ul>

<p>The App does <strong>not</strong> modify existing Pins, delete content, follow/unfollow users, or take any actions that you did not directly trigger.</p>

<hr>

<h2>3. Data Storage</h2>
<p>In compliance with Pinterest’s API guidelines, the App:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Does not permanently store</strong> Pinterest data retrieved through the API.</li>
    <li>Only processes Pinterest data temporarily to complete user‑requested actions.</li>
    <li>Does not combine Pinterest data with data from other users or external platforms.</li>
    <li>Does not sell, share, or transfer Pinterest data to any third parties.</li>
</ul>

<p>Affiliate data (e.g., product links from Amazon or Temu) is not provided by Pinterest and is managed independently by the user.</p>

<hr>

<h2>4. User Initiated Actions Only</h2>
<p>The App does not perform automated actions on your Pinterest account. For example:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Users must select or approve every Pin to be created.</li>
    <li>No automated following, unfollowing, liking, saving, or commenting is performed.</li>
    <li>No bulk automated posting occurs without explicit user approval.</li>
</ul>

<p>Actions such as scheduling or automation (e.g., via n8n) still require the user to configure and explicitly authorize them.</p>

<hr>

<h2>5. How We Use Your Information</h2>
<p>We only use Pinterest information to provide services directly to the user who authorized access. This includes:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Creating user‑approved Pins</li>
    <li>Choosing the board for publishing</li>
    <li>Displaying available boards to the user</li>
</ul>

<p>We do NOT:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Use Pinterest data for advertising outside Pinterest</li>
    <li>Use Pinterest data for competitor research or benchmarking</li>
    <li>Share Pinterest data with any third‑party advertising networks</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>6. Third‑Party Services</h2>
<p>The App may work with third‑party affiliate programs (such as Amazon or Temu) for product URLs only. These services are not connected to Pinterest API access or user data.</p>

<p>Your interactions with affiliate platforms are governed by their own Privacy Policies.</p>

<hr>

<h2>7. Keeping Your Data Secure</h2>
<p>We protect your data by:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Storing OAuth tokens securely</li>
    <li>Preventing unauthorized access to API credentials</li>
    <li>Not sharing API credentials with any third party</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>8. Revoking Access</h2>
<p>Users may revoke the App’s access to their Pinterest account at any time via Pinterest’s settings:</p>
<p><em>Settings → Security & Logins → Apps</em></p>

<p>Once revoked, the App loses all access to Pinterest data and no further actions can be taken.</p>

<hr>

<h2>9. Contact Us</h2>

<p>By using the App, you agree to this Privacy Policy.</p>
