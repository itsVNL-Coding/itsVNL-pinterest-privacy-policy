<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>Last updated: <strong>November 18th, 2025</strong></p>

<p>This Privacy Policy explains how my personal app (“the App”) handles data when connecting to Pinterest using the official Pinterest API. The App is used for <strong>personal purposes only</strong>, through n8n workflows, to create Pins on my own Pinterest account. No other users’ accounts are accessed, and no data is shared with third parties.</p>

<hr>

<h2>1. What the App Does</h2>
<p>The App allows me to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Create Pins on my Pinterest account using n8n workflows.</li>
    <li>Automate Pin creation for my own content.</li>
</ul>
<p>All actions require my explicit authorization through Pinterest OAuth, and the App does not perform any actions on other users’ accounts.</p>

<hr>

<h2>2. How Pinterest Data Is Accessed</h2>
<p>The App uses Pinterest’s OAuth 2.0 flow. I must explicitly authorize the App to access my Pinterest account. The App does <strong>not</strong> request or store Pinterest passwords, session cookies, or login credentials.</p>

<p>Once authorized, the App may access:</p>
<ul>
    <li>My public profile information</li>
    <li>My boards (to allow me to choose where a Pin will be published)</li>
    <li>Posting capabilities for creating Pins (only when I initiate the action)</li>
</ul>

<p>The App does <strong>not</strong> modify existing Pins, delete content, follow/unfollow other users, or take any actions I did not directly trigger.</p>

<hr>

<h2>3. Data Storage</h2>
<p>The App:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Does not permanently store Pinterest data retrieved through the API.</li>
    <li>Only processes Pinterest data temporarily to complete my actions.</li>
    <li>Does not combine Pinterest data with other users’ accounts or external platforms.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>4. User Initiated Actions Only</h2>
<p>All actions are performed only after my explicit authorization:</p>
<ul>
    <li>I must select or approve every Pin to be created.</li>
    <li>No automated following, unfollowing, liking, saving, or commenting occurs.</li>
    <li>Automation through n8n is configured and triggered by me only.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>5. How I Use My Information</h2>
<p>Pinterest data is used only to create Pins on my own account and to display my boards for selection. The App does <strong>not</strong> use Pinterest data for advertising, competitor research, or share it with any third parties.</p>

<hr>

<h2>6. Keeping My Data Secure</h2>
<ul>
    <li>OAuth tokens are stored securely.</li>
    <li>Unauthorized access to API credentials is prevented.</li>
    <li>API credentials are not shared with any third party.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>7. Revoking Access</h2>
<p>I may revoke the App’s access to my Pinterest account at any time via Pinterest’s settings:</p>
<p><em>Settings → Security & Logins → Apps</em></p>

<p>Once revoked, the App loses all access to Pinterest data and cannot perform any actions.</p>

<hr>

<h2>8. Contact</h2>

<p>By using the App, I agree to this Privacy Policy.</p>
